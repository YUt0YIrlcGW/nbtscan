.SH DESCRIPTION
NBTscan is a program for scanning IP networks for NetBIOS name information. It sends
NetBIOS status query to each address in supplied range and lists received information
in human readable form. For each responded host it lists IP address, NetBIOS computer
name, logged-in user name and MAC address (such as Ethernet).
.PP
NBTscan produces a report like that:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    IP address     NetBIOS Name  Server    User           MAC address
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    192.168.1.2    MYCOMPUTER              JDOE           00-a0-c9-12-34-56
    192.168.1.5    WIN98COMP     <server>  RROE           00-a0-c9-78-90-00
    192.168.1.123  DPTSERVER     <server>  ADMINISTRATOR  08-00-09-12-34-56

First column lists IP address of responded host. Second column is computer name. Third
column indicates if this computer shares or is able to share files or printers. For NT
machine it means that Server Service is running on this computer. For Windows 95 it
means that "I want to be able to give others access to my files" or "I want to be able
to allow others to print on my \fBprinter\fP(s)" checkbox is ticked (in Control
Panel/Network/File and Print Sharing). Most often it means that this computer shares
files. Third column shows user name. If no one is logged on from this computer it is
same as computer name. Last column shows adapter MAC address.
.PP
If run with \fB-v\fP switch NBTscan lists whole NetBIOS name table for each responded address.
The output looks like that:

.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B
\fB-v\fP
Verbose output. Print all names received from each host.
.TP
.B
\fB-d\fP
Dump packets. Print whole packet contents. Cannot be used
with \fB-v\fP, \fB-s\fP or \fB-h\fP options.
.TP
.B
\fB-e\fP
Format output in /etc/hosts format.
.TP
.B
\fB-l\fP
Format output in lmhosts format.
.TP
.B
\fB-t\fP <\fItimeout\fP>
Wait \fItimeout\fP seconds for response. Default 1.
.TP
.B
\fB-b\fP <\fIbandwidth\fP>
Output  throttling. Slow down output so that it uses no more that
\fIbandwidth\fP bps. Useful on slow links, so that outgoing queries don't
get dropped.
.TP
.B
\fB-r\fP
Use local port 137 for scans. Win95 boxes respond to this only. You
need to be root to use this option.
.TP
.B
\fB-q\fP
Suppress banners and error messages.
.TP
.B
\fB-s\fP <\fIseparator\fP>
Script-friendly output. Don't print column and record headers,
separate fields with \fIseparator\fP.
.TP
.B
\fB-h\fP
Print human-readable names for services. Can only be used with \fB-v\fP
option.
.TP
.B
\fB-m\fP <\fIretransmits\fP>
Number of \fIretransmits\fP. Default 0.
.TP
.B
\fB-f\fP <\fIfilename\fP>
Take IP addresses to scan from file "\fIfilename\fP"
.TP
.B
\fItarget\fP
NBTscan is a command-line tool. You have to supply at least one
argument, the address range, in one of three forms:
.RS
.TP
.B
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Single IP in dotted-decimal notation. Example: 192.168.1.1
.TP
.B
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx
Net address and subnet mask. Example: 192.168.1.0/24
.TP
.B
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx-xxx
Address range. Example: 192.168.1.1-127. This will scan all
addresses from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.127

.nf
.fam C
    nbtscan 192.168.1.25-137

.fam T
.fi
Scans C-class network. Prints results in script-friendly format using colon as field
\fIseparator\fP:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    nbtscan -v -s : 192.168.1.0/24

.fam T
.fi
The last command produces output like that:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    192.168.0.1:NT_SERVER:00U
    192.168.0.1:MY_DOMAIN:00G

    192.168.0.2:OTHER_BOX:00U
    \.\.\.

.fam T

.fam C
    nbtscan -f iplist

.SH FAQ
.IP 1. 4
NBTscan lists my Windows boxes just fine but does not list my Unixes or routers. Why?
.PP
R: That is the way it is supposed to work. NBTscan uses NetBIOS for scanning and NetBIOS
is only implemented by Windows (and some software on Unix such as Samba).
.IP 2. 4
Why do I get "Connection reset by peer" errors on Windows 2000?
.PP
R: NBTscan uses port 137 UDP for sending queries. If the port is closed on destination
host destination will reply with ICMP "Port unreachable" message. Most operating system
will ignore this message. Windows 2000 reports it to the application as "Connection
reset by peer" error. Just ignore it.
.IP 3. 4
Why NBTscan doesn't scan for shares? Are you going to add share scanning to NBTscan?
.PP
R: No. NBTscan uses UDP for what it does. That makes it very fast. Share scanning
requires TCP. For one thing, it will make \fBnbtscan\fP more slow. Also adding share scanning
means adding a lot of new code to \fBnbtscan\fP. There is a lot of good share scanners around,
so there is no reason to duplicate that work.
.IP 4. 4
Why do I get 00-00-00-00-00-00 instead of MAC address when I scan a Samba box?
.PP
R: Because that's what Samba send in response to the query. Nbtscan just prints out what
it gets.
