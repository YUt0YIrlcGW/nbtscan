NBTscan version 1.0.2. Copyright (C) 1999-2000 Alla Bezroutchko

NBTscan is a program for scanning IP networks for NetBIOS name
information. It sends NetBIOS status query to each address in
supplied range and lists received information in human
readable form. For each responded host it lists IP address,
NetBIOS computer name, logged-in user name and MAC address 
(such as Ethernet).

INSTALLATION.

NBTscan compiles and runs on Unix and Windows. I have tested it
on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 95, Windows 98, FreeBSD 2.2.7, 
FreeBSD 3.1, and Solaris 2.6/Intel. Steve Coleman 
<Steve.Coleman@jhuapl.edu> ported NBTscan to Solaris, HP-UX and 
OSF/1 and fixed several bugs. He reports that NBTscan also runs 
on IRIX/SGI with minor problems.

Windows:

To compile this under Windows you will need Cygwin. You can
download it from http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/download.html
Install it and start the shell. Make directory named bin in
root directory of the drive you have installed Cygwin to.
Suppose you have installed Cygwin into "C:\Program Files\cygnus".
Then you should create directory c:\bin. Then you will need
to mount real bin directory to /bin with the command like that:

mount "/program files/cygnus/cygwin-b20/H-i586-cygwin32/bin" /bin

Untar nbtscan with:

tar zxvf nbtscan.tar.gz

Go to nbtscan directory and run a script named 'configure' like
that:

./configure

Type 'make' at Cygwin command prompt. This will compile and 
build nbtscan.exe. If make finishes without errors, type
'make install'. This will copy nbtscan.exe to location specified
in BINDIR (c: by default).

To run it independently (without Cygwin) find file named 
cygwin1.dll and copy it to winnt\system32 (or windows\system 
under Windows 95)
   
Unix:
Do

./configure

make

make install

That's all.

RUNNING.

Usage: nbtscan [-v] [-d] [-t timeout] [-b bandwidth] [-r] [-q] [-s separator] <scan_range>
        -v              verbose output. Print all names received
                        from each host
        -d              dump packets. Print whole packet contents.
                        Cannot be used with -v, -s or -h options.
        -t timeout      wait timeout seconds for response.
                        Default 1.
        -b bandwidth    Output throttling. Slow down output
                        so that it uses no more that bandwidth bps.
                        Useful on slow links, so that ougoing queries
                        don't get dropped.
        -r              use local port 137 for scans. Win95 boxes
                        respond to this only.
                        You need to be root to use this option on Unix.
        -q              Suppress banners and error messages,
        -s separator    Script-friendly output. Don't print
                        column and record headers, separate fields with separator.
        -h              Print human-readble names for services.
                        Can only be used with -v option.
        -m retransmits  Number of retransmits. Default 0.
        <scan_range>    what to scan. Can either be single IP
                        like 192.168.1.1 or
                        range of addresses in one of two forms:
                        xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx or xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx-xxx.
Examples:
        nbtscan -r 192.168.1.0/24
                Scans the whole C-class network.
        nbtscan 192.168.1.25-137
                Scans a range from 192.168.1.25 to 192.168.1.137
        nbtscan -v -s : 192.168.1.0/24
                Scans C-class network. Prints results in script-friendly
                format using colon as field separator.
                Produces output like that:
                192.168.0.1:NT_SERVER:00U
                192.168.0.1:MY_DOMAIN:00G
                192.168.0.1:ADMINISTRATOR:03U
                192.168.0.2:OTHER_BOX:00U
                ...

BUGS/LIMITATIONS

Windows version has a certain limitation: you cannot scan Win95 
hosts with it because Windows 95 always sends responses to name 
queries to port 137, and you cannot bind to port 137 under
Windows (it is already taken by Windows itself).

Report bugs to alla@sovlink.ru (that's me). I cannot promise to
do anything but I might well want fix it. Remember: no warranty.
At least it's worth what you payed for it.
